											<h1 class="entry-title">We start with the facts. <span>[ Our Process ]</span></h1>
					
					<div class="entry-content">
						<p>We begin every project the same way: understand the client and the project at hand. Once we have a full grasp of the task, our creative exploration begins. Our branding, marketing collateral design, digital design and development, and advertising solutions speak directly to your audience.</p>

<h3>1. Research</h3>
<p>We put some legwork in. We assess your existing branding and materials, and conduct company, consumer and marketplace research through interviews and independent channels. These reports assure our findings are in line with your objectives.</p>

<h3>2. Strategy</h3>
<p>Using the found research, we provide strategic direction and messaging by defining your company’s competitive edge and points of differentiation. We outline the best ways for you to speak to your consumer and stand out amongst your competitors. Our strategy drives the content and visual identity, assuring seamless communications across all media.</p>

<h3>3. Design</h3>
<p>Once we’ve crafted the strategy, we design how your brand might take shape. We provide logo, imagery, color, and typography recommendations. We consider how these elements interact in print and digital environments — in a browser, on your phone, in a brochure, or at an event, all in a consistent way.</p>

<h3>4. Evolution</h3>
<p>As needs evolve, brands do too. We stay on top of current trends to make recommendations for targeted, relevant and fresh communications.</p>
